### Added Dependencies

- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor for styling
- **Zustand**: State management library for handling game state
- **gh-pages**: For easy deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Vitest**: Test runner and framework optimized for Vite projects
- **React Testing Library**: Utility for rendering and testing React components from a user perspective (render, screen, fireEvent)
- **Terser**: JavaScript minifier for better production builds

## Architecture

This project implements a clean architecture based on:

- **Presentational Components**: The UI components (Card, CardGrid, Header) are purely presentational and only responsible for rendering the data they receive via props.
- **State Management Separation**: All game logic and state management is centralized in the Zustand store, completely separated from the UI components.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows down from the store to the components, and actions flow up from components to the store.

This separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand.
